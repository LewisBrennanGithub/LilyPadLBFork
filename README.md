Social Media app for Frogs, Javascript 1-week long group project.
To run the app locally
This app makes use of Node.js, React, MongoDB, and Express to run. Recommended software: Mongo DB Compass (database), VScode (view code). 
Open your terminal:
Go to the server directory and enter npm run seeds and npm install to create and populate the database with pre-stored data. Run npm run server:dev to run the back-end on http://localhost:9000
Go to the client directory and type npm install to install dependencies. Run npm start to run the front-end on http://localhost:3000

### To use the app

The app does not have a fully integrated login function. Instead, a pseudo-login feature was put in place to allow interaction with the app as different users.
After launching the app, go to "Frog-in" or "Profile" (bottom right options on mobile). On the redirected page, scroll down to the Login section. 
Clicking on any frog user will log you in as said user and redirect you to their profile. You will now be able to create posts and responses as the chosen user.
To change user, go back to the "Frog-in" option, and select any other frog user.
